                    Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point.
                    When you click Online Video, you can paste in the embed code
                    for the video you want to add. You can also type a keyword
                    to search online for the video that best fits your document.
                    To make your document look professionally produced, Word
                    provides header, footer, cover page, and text box designs
                    that complement each other. For example, you can add a
                    matching cover page, header, and sidebar. Click Insert and
                    then choose the elements you want from the different
                    galleries. Themes and styles also help keep your document
                    coordinated. When you click Design and choose a new Theme,
                    the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match
                    your new theme. When you apply styles, your headings change
                    to match the new theme. Save time in Word with new buttons
                    that show up where you need them. To change the way a
                    picture fits in your document, click it and a button for
                    layout options appears next to it. When you work on a table,
                    click where you want to add a row or a column, and then
                    click the plus sign. Reading is easier, too, in the new
                    Reading view. You can collapse parts of the document and
                    focus on the text you want. If you need to stop reading
                    before you reach the end, Word remembers where you left off
                    - even on another device. Video provides a powerful way to
                    help you prove your point. When you click Online Video, you

                    example, you can add a matching cover page, header, and
                    sidebar. Click Insert and then choose the elements you want
                    from the different galleries. Themes and styles also help

                    time in Word with new buttons that show up where you need
                    them. To change the way a picture fits in your document,
                    click it and a button for layout options appears next to it.
                    When you work on a table, click where you want to add a row
